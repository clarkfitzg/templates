    \[
        X \sim \text{Binom} (10, 0.5)
\]
    
I'd like to know the probability mass function at 4.

    \emph{Is this code correct? incorrect?}

\begin{verbatim}
def f(n):
    'computes n!'
    return functools.reduce(operator.mul, range(n))

def binom(n, k):
    'computes n choose k'
    return f(n) / (f(k) * f(n - k))

def binom_pmf(n, p, k):
    'The probability mass function of Binom(n, p)'
    return binom(n, k) * p ** (n - k) * (1 - p) ** k
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Correct!}

I want to program the way I think, and just have it work perfectly.

    \frametitle{}

    With RV's we ask the same questions over and over.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item What's the mean?
        \item Given some data, what's the MLE for a parameter?
        \item Give me $n$ samples of some random variable $X$.
        \item What's the cdf of X with parameter $\beta$ evaluated at $k$?
    \end{itemize}

    That's why we had books of tables!

    But now we have computers.
